COMP 580 Project

Thump It! Is an accessible mobile game for iOS and Android users. The intent of this game was to provide an interactive gameplay experience for blind and deaf communities by featuring both visual and audio commands. 

As discussed in the video, the game gives you a never-ending series of commands such as "Thump It!" and "Swipe Right!" that both appear on the screen and are spoken. After successfully completeing a command, the time to complete the next one decreases. Upon taking too long or doing the wrong command, the game is over and you rscore is shown.

Our project was developed using React Native and Expo, as well as a number of React Native npm packages such as 'react-native-swipe-gestures' and 'react-native-stack-navigator."
